//inentifiers are the names given to various elements in a program, such as variables, functions, classes, etc. In C++, identifiers must follow certain rules and conventions.

//Rules for Identifiers in C++:

//Identifiers can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_).

//Identifiers must begin with a letter or an underscore.

//Identifiers are case-sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different.

//Identifiers cannot contain spaces or special characters, such as @, $, %, etc.

//_at start is used for private variables and __at start is used for system variables.

//data types in c++:

//int, char, float, double, bool, void, wide char, long, short, long long, unsigned, signed, auto, static, const, volatile, mutable, extern, register, typedef, enum, union, struct, class, size_t, nullptr, decltype, typeid, string, vector, array, list, forward_list, deque, stack, queue, priority_queue, set, multiset, map, multimap, unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, unordered_multimap, pair, tuple, bitset, shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weak_ptr, function, bind, ref, cref, mem_fn, thread, mutex, condition_variable, atomic, future, promise, async, launch, system_error, error_code, error_condition, category.
